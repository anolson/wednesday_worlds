Out Tabor Rd, back on Blackburg Rd

From Bollo's, we head out N. Main St to Mt Tabor Rd. We re-group at Slusser's Chapel, where the B group is given a head start (~2-3 mins).

We ride out Mt Tabor Rd and make a right turn onto Sandy Ridge Rd.

The only sprint is at Dry Run Rd.  Finally, we finish at the top of Harding.
