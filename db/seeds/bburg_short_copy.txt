Out and back on Blackburg Rd

From Bollo's, we head down Harding Ave. We re-group at the intersection of Blacksburg Rd, where the B group is given a head start (~ 1 min).

The first sprint is at Sandy Ridge. We re-group again there and head back in on Blacksburg Rd.

The next sprint is at Dry Run Rd. Finally, we finish at the top of Harding.
