  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    Wednesday Worlds is a groupride in Blacksburg, VA. It takes place weekly from March to
    September. We leave from <%= link_to "Bollo's", "http://www.bolloscafe.com/" %> coffee shop each
    week on Wednesday night. We alternate between various different <%= link_to_if(events.any?,
    "rides", '#rides') %> throughout the year. They both take a little under two hours to complete.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're interested in coming on the ride, you should have some experience riding in a group
    with others. You should also take a look at the <%= link_to "guidelines", '#guidelines' %>. We
    usually split into two groups (A and B) for the fast part of the ride, and if you're unsure, you
    should start off in the B group.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ride is great way to build speed and fitness on the bike. It is also a good way to get
    more comfortable riding with a larger group of riders. On top of all that it's a lot of fun.
